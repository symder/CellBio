    "feedback": "True; an Isotope is a like a mutation of the common cold. It's a slight change the virus made so it can reinfect you, but it's still fundamentally the same illness. Similarly, Isotopes are variants of an Atom with abnormal Neutron counts, which can affect how behaves."

    "correctIndex": 2,
    "feedback": "Radioactive decay, known as Half-Life, goes from Unstable to Stable condition. For example, fuel rods from nuclear reactors need to be stored as they are still emitting radiation. Once they decay, in theory the rods would be safe to handle again."
