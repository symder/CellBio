    "correctIndex": 2,
    "feedback": "Radioactive decay, known as Half-Life, goes from Unstable to Stable condition. For example, fuel rods from nuclear reactors need to be stored as they are still emitting radiation. Once they decay, in theory the rods would be safe to handle again."

    "choices": ["It is stable and unlikely to bond with other atoms", "It is unstable and will readily bond with other elements", "It is negatively charged", "It is positively charged"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "feedback": "It is unstable; Valence (outermost) electron shells want to have an even number, and will try to get 8 electrons (Octet Rule) in it's shell. Chlorine will want to bond with Hydrogen, which has 1 electron in it's valence shell, to form Hydrogen Chloride. This is a gas, but when dissolved in water becomes Hydrochloric Acid, which is found in your stomach."
